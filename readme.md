UKS-KPBS Compatibility
===

This is a set of configuration files to allow use of the Kerbal Planetary Base System parts with the USI Life Support & Kolonization System gameplay mechanics.

### Dependencies

- [Kerbal Planetary Base System] (http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/127413-WIP-1-0-4-Kerbal-Planetary-Base-Systems-v0-2-4-Update-13-9-2015) by Nils277
- [USI Life Support] (https://github.com/BobPalmer/USI-LS) by RoverDude/BobPalmer
- [USI Kolonization System] (https://github.com/BobPalmer/MKS) by RoverDude/BobPalmer

### Installation

Delete any existing installed version of this mod, then drop the UKS-KPBS_Compatibility folder into your GameData folder wherever KSP is installed.

### Features

USI Life Support functions are added to KPBS modules:

- The Habitat Mk1 works as a mid-grade life support recycler (34%); the Science Lab has a 71% recycler; and the Habitat Mk2 has the highest-efficiency recycler (90%), but requires Water as input.
- The Habitat modules have habitation space.
- The Cupola works as a habitation multiplier.
- The small (wedge-shaped) and large (deployable) Greenhouse use Agroponics to convert Mulch and Fertilizer into Supplies.

UKS features are also incorporated:

- The large Greenhouse has a Cultivator to turn Substrate, Water, and Fertilizer into Supplies.
- The Command Module works as a power & resource distributor.
- All modules incorporate a power coupler to tap into the power distribution network.
- Switchable storage wedges in two sizes are added for UKS resources; these function as distribution warehouses like Kontainers.
- The Algae Farm has converters to create Fertilizer from Gypsum and Water from Hydrates.

The following modules are added:

- Inline versions of the MEU-250, -500, and -750 drills
- Inline versions of the Mk3 Fabricator, Refinery, and Sifter

## Differences from UKS Modules

For balance reasons, the following differences from regular UKS modules were made:

- Drills have 75% efficiency. The MEU-750 drill is only 50% efficient for drilling water; the stock K&K Water drill can be used for higher efficiency. Each drill holds a maximum of 10 units of each resource.
- The Mk3 Refinery, Sifter, and Fabricator are only 80% as efficient; output is reduced by 20%.
- The Mk3 Refinery, Sifter, and Fabricator modules have no crew capacity.
- The Mk3 Refinery, Sifter, and Fabricator modules have no electric capacity.
- The Mk3 Refinery, Sifter, and Fabricator modules have a maximum Recyclables storage of 200.
- The Mk3 Refinery, Sifter, and Fabricator modules do not need other modules to operate (workshops).


### Known Issues

The switchable storage wedges use the NOMS texture for every configuration. The inline drills use the same model and color as the K&K Water drill; and the Mk3 modules use the ISRU model. If you can create custom textures, feel free to submit a pull request!
